# Bank Account Tracking software

With an increase in digital services, it is paramount for a company who wishes to stay relevant with customers offers them methods to quickly and conveniently review their accounts. The software will assist the customer in tracking the money they have in their accounts. It will allow the recording and review of the transactions that have been made on their account and display them in a readable format. Customers who previously took up the time of the bank tellers enquiring about their balances and transactions will now be able to do this themselves, freeing up those tellers to deal with customer's other requests. This will reduce the amount of time spent dealing with customers without a sacrifice to the quality of the service given. This should speed up the process for those waiting their turn, increasing overall customer satisfaction, even by those choosing not to use the system.

The statement report will be formatted to make it easy to read by the customer, with red text clearly indicating debit transactions and negative balances and green text for credit transactions and positive balances, with the column widths adjusting to match the necessary characters to display the numbers neatly. In addition there is an optional overdraft facility which can be activated by the bank and allow the bank to set a value for that overdraft. This will allow a customer to go into negative balances, but only up to the value of the overdraft.
